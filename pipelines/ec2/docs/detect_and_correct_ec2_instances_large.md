## Overview

EC2 instances can be quite costly to retain, it is also likely that after a certain point in time they're no longer required and should be cleaned up to prevent further costs. Large EC2 instances are unusual, expensive and should be reviewed.

This pipeline detects large EC2 instances and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

## Getting Started

This control will work out-of-the-box with some sensible defaults (configurable via [variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables)).

You should be able to simply run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ec2_instances_large
```

By default, Flowpipe runs in [wizard](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#wizard) mode and prompts directly in the terminal for a decision on the action(s) to take for each detected resource.

However, you can run Flowpipe in [server](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server) mode with [external integrations](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input#create-an-integration), allowing it to prompt for input via `http`, `slack`, `teams`, etc.

Alternatively, you can choose to configure and run in other modes:
* [Notify](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#notify): Provides detections without taking any corrective action.
* [Automatic](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#automatic): Performs corrective actions automatically without user intervention.
