## Overview

Lambda functions without graviton processor incur cost over time, with graviton processor (arm64 - 64-bit ARM architecture), you can save money in two ways: First, your functions run more efficiently due to the Graviton architecture. Second, you pay less for the time that they run. In fact, Lambda functions powered by Graviton are designed to deliver up to 19 percent better performance at 20 percent lower cost.

This pipeline detects Lambda functions without graviton processor and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

## Getting Started

This control will work out-of-the-box with some sensible defaults (configurable via [variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables)).

You should be able to simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_lambda_functions_without_graviton
```

By default, Flowpipe runs in [wizard](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#wizard) mode and prompts directly in the terminal for a decision on the action(s) to take for each detected resource.

However, you can run Flowpipe in [server](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server) mode with [external integrations](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input#create-an-integration), allowing it to prompt for input via `http`, `slack`, `teams`, etc.

Alternatively, you can choose to configure and run in other modes:
* [Notify](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#notify): Provides detections without taking any corrective action.
* [Automatic](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#automatic): Performs corrective actions automatically without user intervention.
