# Detect & correct VPC NAT gateways if unused

## Overview

NAT gateways are charged per hour once they are provisioned and available, so unused gateways should be deleted to prevent costs.

This pipeline detects unused NAT gateways and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

## Getting Started

This control will work out-of-the-box with some sensible defaults (configurable via [variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables)).

You should be able to simply run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_vpc_nat_gateways_if_unused
```

By default, Flowpipe runs in [wizard](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#wizard) mode and prompts directly in the terminal for a decision on the action(s) to take for each detected resource.

However, you can run Flowpipe in [server](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server) mode with [external integrations](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input#create-an-integration), allowing it to prompt for input via `http`, `slack`, `teams`, etc.

Alternatively, you can choose to configure and run in other modes:
* [notify](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#notify): Provides detections without taking any corrective action.
* [automatic](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_thrifty#automatic): Performs corrective actions automatically without user intervention.
