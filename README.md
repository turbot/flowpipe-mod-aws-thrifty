# AWS Thrifty Mod for Flowpipe

Pipelines to detect & correct misconfigurations leading to AWS savings opportunities.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/flowpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) as the data source. 

Install [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
flowpipe mod init
flowpipe mod install github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws-thrifty
```

### Configure Variables

Several pipelines have [input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#input-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements.

Each variable has a default defined in it's source file, e.g, `s3/s3.fp` (or `variables.fp` for more generic variables), but these can be overwritten in several ways:

The easiest approach is to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp thrifty.fpvars.example thrifty.fpvars
vi thrifty.fpvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --var=ebs_snapshot_age_max_days=10
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export FP_VAR_ebs_snapshot_age_max_days=10
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age
```

For more information, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#passing-input-variables)

### Running Your First Detection

Once you've configured your variables, you can get started by simply running one of the available pipelines:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age
```

Each detection has a corresponding [Query Trigger](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/query), by default - these are `Disabled` so that you can customize which you wish to enable and the frequency of their running. <!-- TODO: Get link to .fptriggers docs once available -->
