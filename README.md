# AWS Thrifty Mod for Flowpipe

Pipelines to detect & correct misconfigurations leading to AWS savings opportunities.

## Getting Started

### Installation

> Note: Docker daemon will need to be installed and running to apply any of the corrective actions via the [AWS Libary Mod](https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws). Please see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more information.

Install [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/flowpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) as the data source. 

Install [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Additionally, it is recommended to use the [Credential Import](https://flowpipe.io/docs/reference/config-files/credential_import) functionality of Flowpipe to import the AWS credentials used from Steampipe, however, these will need to have permissions to perform corrective actions.

Clone the mod:

```sh
mkdir aws-thrifty
cd aws-thrifty
git clone git@github.com:turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws-thrifty.git
```

### Configure Variables

Several pipelines have [input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#input-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements.

Each variable has a default defined in its source file, e.g, `s3/s3.fp` (or `variables.fp` for more generic variables), but these can be overwritten in several ways:

The easiest approach is to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp thrifty.fpvars.example thrifty.fpvars
vi thrifty.fpvars

flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --var-file=thrifty.fpvars
```

Alternatively, you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --var=ebs_snapshot_age_max_days=10
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export FP_VAR_ebs_snapshot_age_max_days=10
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age
```

For more information, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#passing-input-variables)

### Running Detect & Correct Pipelines

To run your first detection, you'll need to ensure your Steampipe server is up and running:
```sh
steampipe service start
```

To find your desired detection, you can filter the `pipeline list` output:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline list | grep "detect_and_correct"
```

Then run your chosen pipeline:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age
```

By default the above approach would find the relevant resources and then send a message to your configured [notifier](https://flowpipe.io/docs/reference/config-files/notifier).

However;  you can request via an [Input Step](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input) a corrective action to run against each detection result; this behavior is achieved by setting `approvers` either as a variable or for a one-off approach, by passing `approvers` as an argument.

> Note: This approach requires running `flowpipe server` as it uses an `input` step.

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --host local --arg='approvers=["default"]'
```

If you're happy to just apply the same action against all detected items, you can apply them without the `input` step by overriding the `default_action` argument (or the detection specific variable).
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --arg='default_action="delete_snapshot"'
```

However; if you have configured a non-empty list for your `approvers` variable, you will need to override it as below:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_ebs_snapshots_exceeding_max_age --arg='approvers=[]' --arg='default_action="delete_snapshot"'
```

Finally, each detection pipeline has a corresponding [Query Trigger](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/query), these are disabled by default allowing for you to configure only those which are required, see the [docs](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws-thrifty/triggers) for more information.
